1. Launch an ec2 instance and use Former2 browser extension and generate the CF script and deploy it. 

2. Create an s3 bucket and configure lifecycle rule. Use Former2 to generate the cft and deploy it by changing the bucket name and test it.

3. Launch an ec2 instance using cloudformation template. While launching use userdata to make it webserver also, open post 80 and 22 open for everyone. Deploy it and test it.

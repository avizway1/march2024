Cloud computing : you are using someone else computer. 

Definition of Cloud Computing : Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive.

NIST Definition of Cloud Computing : 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Pay-as-go ==> Pay for the resources you are actually using.. 
if you are using a server for 5 min, you will get charged for 5 min only.. 


On-demand self-service : you can choose what service you want to use. you will get charged for the resources you are actually using. you no need to depend on service provider to get these things done.

Rapid elasticity : We can easily Upgrade and downgrade the resources. it wont take much time to perform. 
Example : We can launch server with very small config, if required we can upgrade same server to very high configuration. No need to sped lot of time. no need to worry about hardware dependencies.


t2.micro	: 1 CPU, 1 RAM 
medium		: 2 CPU, 4 RAM
xlarge		: 4 CPU, 16 RAM


Measured Services : Whatever you use, the usage will be measured. (per gb/month, /hr, /sec)

Broad network access & High Availability : Cloud service providers has infra almost across the globe. Instead of spending time and building our own infra, we can use this cloud providers infra and deliver our application quickly.

Resource pooling. : You can use cloud shared tenancy mechanism to save cost. Underlying resources share with multiple customers.

----------------

Pay-as-you-go : pay for the resources you are actually using. 

You used a server for 1 hr in a day = 1 hr cost..

----------------

DEPLOYMENT MODELS :

Public cloud : THis model is open for everyone. Anyone can create an accont and start using. 
Azure, GCP, AWS..  Maintenance : Service provider responsibility. 

Private cloud  : Not open for everyone, Dedicated for only one organisation.  Only that org users / only authorised uses can use. Maint: Your team can fix it / you can take assistance from 3rd party.

Hybrid cloud : Combination of one or more cloud deployment models.. Public + public / Public + private
Existing Servers + creting new svrs in AWS..  Azure + AWS.. 
==> Site-to-site VPN connection, AWS Direct Connect

Community cloud : group of org build the infra together and only that group of org use that infra. main : One of the org from group / 3rd party.

=========

Service models of Cloud Computing : 

-> IaaS : We need takes care about the OS level onwords. No need to take care about Physical resources.

-> PaaS : Platform as a Service : Moderate efforts.. Our efforts is to design application only, not infra management / configuration management.

-> SaaS : Software as a Service : No efforts / very very less efforts.



Requirement : I need a webpage that can be accesable across the globe.

What is AWS.?

AWS is CLoud service provider (CSP).
AWS Builds Data centers across the globe, They provide infra for Org on pay-as-you-go model.
(Servers, Network, Database, storage, applications, platforms, monitor)


Common CSP :
--> AWS : 2004 onwords.. Oficiallyt launched in 2006 : Chrispinkman and benjamin black : SQS, S3 and EC2
--> Azure
--> GCP
--> Oracle Cloud
--> Alibaba Cloud
--> tencent Cloud
--> IBM Cloud


AWS Global infra : 

Region : 33 regions (as of March 24).. geographical location or physical location..  Every region contains multiple AZs.

AZ / Availability Zones : AZ is nothing but a Data Center or combination of Multiple DCs. All the Infra resources runs/available here. Each AZ connects with another AZ with Multiple redundant connectivity. As of march, 24, 105 AZs.. 

PoP / point of Presence / EDGE locations : These are Cached locations. Whatever the data we want to deliver to end customer, we can store the data near to end cistomer location temporarily. So that customer request delivered quickly.
Works with CDN Mechanism (Content Delivery network).


TTL : time to Live : We can configure, how long you want to store the data in Edge location with TTL values.

forcefully you want to clear all the cache : perform "Invalidation"


newspaper : 1 day
prime video : max : 365 days

--------
A company is developing a product. They want to sell..

1 CEO : Access to all data across all departments.			: Root user
10 memebers : 												: IAM users
	--> Accounting : salary, budgeting : 2 guys
	--> marketing : Mark, camps, events, digital marketing : 2 users
	--> IT Admin : Databse, network, storage, servers and user laptops
	--> Developers : Developing the product, product customosatio
	
In org, we always follow, "least privilages mechanism" ; Provide the permissions to perform his job roles only.
	
1 root user ; he will have unrestricted access to AWS account and services.
IAM users : 
	--> DBA : 1 IAM user with RDS full Access : he can access only RDS.
	--> Storage Admins : 1 IAM user with S3 full Access : he can access only S3
	--> Developers : IAM users.. Manage their permisisons.. 
	--> Monitoring Team / production Support : IAM user with read only access.. 
	
Policy : Document that contains set of permissions on AWS services.

ec2 : launch server
s3 : storage
rds : databse

Root user : Have access on AWS Account as well as Services. 
IAM user with Administrator Access : Have access on AWS Services only, not on Account management. 
Cant manage account level things.. Change SP, Changing payment info

--------


Root user : When ever you are login using an email id and password, we call that user as "root user". 
==> Root user have unrestricted access on our AWS account.
==> Changing support plan / changing payment methods / closing aws account / transfer account.

We can secure this account by enabling MFA / 2-factor authentication.


IAM User : Identity and Access Management : In IAM, We can create users, groups and we can manage user permissions. 

Policy : Set of permissions on our AWS Services.


--> least privilages mechanism.


Enable Free Tier Alerts : Login to your aws account, Navihate to "Billing and Cost management", Navihate to "billing Preferences", Enable Alert preferences. Enter your email id.


aws.amazon.com/free : First 12 months some of the aws services are free. 


Root user : Unrestricted access on AWS account.

IAM user with Administrator Access : Almost similar to root user, but he cannot perform account management related activities (account closing / changing support plan / changing payment methods).


https://avizway9.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


Task 0 : Create an AWS account and Setup password standard, Account Alias for your AWS accounts.

Task 1 : Create an IAM user, Add  "AdministratorAccess" policy. Login and try to access "Billing information". It will Deny. 
--> provide Billing access to the above IAM user.

Task 2 : create an IAM user, Add "S3FullAccess", login as this user and create a bucket. Now navigate to IAM service and try to create an IAM user and verify.!

Task 3 : create an IAM user, Add "EC2FullAccess", login as this user and try to create a bucket in s3 service..


================================================================================

D: 16/03/24


https://501170964283.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
https://avizway9.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


--> Enable Free Tier alerts : Whenever you are exceeding free tier usage, we can get alert to given email id. To configure this, Login to your aws account, Navigate to "billing and cost management", look for "Billing Preferences",  and "Alert preferences" then enable free tier alerts.

Configure "Zero Spend" budget alert.. : Whenever any aws service is startyed costing us, we will get alert to given emails. Choose "Zero spend budget", 

-> Navigate to "Billing and cost management", then "Budgets and Planning" choose "Budgets".


Implicit Allow : We can access only the services allocated. If we try to access any other service, it will Deny.

Explicit Deny : he can access anything, even something is introduced future, he can access.. But ANything specifically denied, he cannot access.



Requirement : I Need an IAM user, He need "AdministratorAccess", but No access on "S3 Service".
Apart from S3, I want this user to work on all other services.


create an IAM user, Provide him "AdministratorAccess", Create a policy that can "Deny S3" and add along with existing permisisons.


Deny will always have highest priority. You allow 100 times, but denied only 1 time, still deny will take effect.

Policy : Set of Permissions on our aws account. Policy writtens in JSON format.
--> AWS Managed - Job Function
--> AWS Managed Policy
--> Customer Managed Policy
__________________

Policy : Document contains set of permissions writtens in JSON format. Policy provide permissions on AWS resources for users/groups/roles.


--> AWS Managed Policy : Policy provided by AWS, Based on Service.
--> AWS managed - Job function policy : policy provided by AWS, It is a combination of multiple Services. AWS provided this based on some standard jobs available in market.
--> Customer Managed policy :  Based on customer requiremnent, he can create and manage.




Task : Enable "free Tier Alerts" on your personal aws accounts.
Task : Configure Zero Spend budget on you personal account.

Task : Create a policy that can allow a user to access "S3 and EC2". Allocate it to an IAM user, login and verify his access.

ARN : Amazon Resource Name : A unique identifier for our resources.

arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/req-user
arn:aws:iam::501170964283:group/S3-Admins-group
arn:aws:s3:::avinash

---------

policy simulator : We can simulate IAM user permissions and get information about the performing activity (allow/deny).

---------

CloudTrail : Logging service in AWS. It logs everything (including refresh also).
--> Enabled by default. We dont have option disable it. 
--> Defaultly it can store last 90 days logs.


-------------

Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource. Hard to track this, Only in special occassions we use this inline policy.

-------------


Task  : Create a custom policy to activate MFA for IAM users, He himself able to activate MFA. 
	Create an IAM user, provide "S3FullAccess". Login as this user and Now try to "Activate MFA". It will give error. Fix this errors and allow him to activate MFA.


Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Want to provide "S3FullAccess" with our custom policy/ Customer Managed policy, We need to restrict this user to work only on specific region (mumbai/ap-south-1).

Create a policy allow all s3 actions on all resources, Add a "requestedRegion" condition.

==> Login as this user, Try to create bucket in "mumbai" it should allow. If you choose any other regions it should not allow.

Task 3 : Test IP Address conditions in IAM policy. 
Create S3FullAccess policy, while creating add your network IP Address, allocate it to an IAM user. 
Now, login as this user and create an S3 bucket, It should work.

Now, Change IP address in above policy, then test it. It should not work.

D: 19/03/24


Inline policy : Its alligened to one particular entity i.e; user, group , role..
--> We have limits on User policy associations, We cannot add more than 20 policies to an IAM user.
--> We can use Inline policy to add more permisisons. 

--> AWS Managed policy 
--> AWS managed - Job function
--> Customer managed policy


Permissions boundary : We can setup permisisons limits by using this permisisons boundary option.

Example scenario: If you create an IAM user with "S3FullAccess" and "EC2FullAccess/*", But permisisons boundary setup to only "S3FullAccess".. Only S3 service is allowed.

-----------

Credential report : It gives all IAM users last logged in, pwd expiration, creation data and accesskeys.


BAU : Business as useual.

Any IAM User will have 2 types of Accesses.
-> Management console access : using Browser you can login to aws account
	-> Sign-In URL
	-> username
	-> Password
-> programatic Access : Install AWS CLI tools, configure CLI, then we can access aws resources.
	-> AccessKey
	-> SecretKey / SecretAccesskey


--> We can integrate AWS IAM Identity service with existing authentication providers. (LDAP) Active Directory)
